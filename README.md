Number Guessing Game with JavaFX GUI

Hello everyone, I'm excited to share my first JavaFX project with you! For those who may not be familiar, JavaFX is a powerful framework for building rich and interactive user interfaces for desktop and mobile applications. For my first project, I decided to create a simple Number Guessing Game.

A number guessing game in JavaFX is a simple game in which the user tries to guess a random number chosen by the computer within a certain range.

Developing this project was a great learning experience, as I faced several challenges along the way. For example, I had to learn how to handle user input. Additionally, I had to experiment with different layouts and design elements to make the game visually appealing and easy to use.

I'm excited to share this project with you and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on how I can improve it. Thank you for taking the time to check out my work!
